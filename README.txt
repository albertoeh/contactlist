It is a basic contact list using Javascript, PHP, MySQL and AJAX. You can see a demo (temporaly) in www.cont.es

STEPS TO INSTALL:
1. It is neccesary to have installed a PHP & MySQL server. If not, I recommend you to install the 'XAMPP' pack
2. Import the database structure using the 'database.sql' file
3. Update the 'application/config/database.php' file with the config of your database
4. If the project path is not in the root of your localhost ('var/www', 'httdocs', ...) you will need to update the '.htaccess' file.
5. Move the files to your PHP localhost.

I used Codeigniter and jQuery as frameworks. If you need more info you should visit their official websites.
